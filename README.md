# AWS-Solutions-Architect-Associate
Hi,

I created this repository to display my competencies in AWS Cloud Solutions Architecture.

I've also shared this as easily digestible articles on Medium!

- [Build a photo book using PIL on Python](https://awongstory.medium.com/build-a-photo-book-using-pil-on-python-610314699d3c "Build a photo book using PIL on Python")
- [Dummy’s Guide to SSH into your AWS EC2 instance for Windows 10/11](https://awongstory.medium.com/dummys-guide-to-ssh-into-your-aws-ec2-instance-for-windows-10-11-e630088e17e4 "Dummy’s Guide to SSH into your AWS EC2 instance for Windows 10/11")

Hope you find this repository helpful.
