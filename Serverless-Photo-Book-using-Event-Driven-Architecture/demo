** Note: You'll need to search for "Building Serverless Applications with an Event-Driven Architecture on the catalog tab.

In this project, I am building a web-based book printing app using a set of serverless technologies. My goals are to learn:

1. Event-driven architecture
2. How Step Functions is configured to orchestrate serverless applications
3. How to take advantage of Amazon SQS and SNS
4. Create and configure Lambda functions and API Gateway resources
5. Made configuration updates to restore API functionality

Key services used in this project:
1. Amazon API Gateway 
2. AWS Lambda - to run code, serverless. 
3. AWS Step Functions - allows coordination of multiple AWS services into serverless workflows, allowing you to build and update apps quickly.
4. Amazon S3 - object storage service
5. Amazon Simple Queue Service/SQS
6. Amazon Simple Notification Service/SNS
7. Amazon Rekognition

APIs used in this project:
1. /presigned - user sends request for presigned URLs to upload their images to an S3 bucket.
2. /CreateBookBinding - user triggers book creation process by indicating that they have finished uploading their images. This triggers the image-processing state machine.
3. /execution - the user approves the PDF by acknowledging an email from Amazon SNS

Step Functions and state machines:
1. ImageProcessStateMachine : the job of this state machine is to pick up user-uploaded images from the S3 /Incoming folder, process the images, and create a PDF album for book printing. Key steps in this flow includes: image validation, resizing, watermarking. 
2. BookprintStateMachine : this state machine reads messages from the print vendor Amazon SQS and sends the photo book to a third-party vendor for printing.
